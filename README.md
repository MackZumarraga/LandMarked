# Landmarked
[Link to Landmarked]()

An online travel journal to track all the great places you visit and all the trips you go on. 

## Background

Completed with a group of 4 members having just been exposed to MongoDB, Landmarked was built using a MERN stack in just under 5 days. 

## Functionality 
 
- Entries - When a user visits a location they are able to create an entry with a message and photo 
showing off their experience at the location.
- Trips - Users can save multiple entries under a trip. 
- Dynamic map 
  - Entries are saved to a location on the map when they are created. By default the user profile page displays a merker for each entry on the map.
  - When a trip is selected the travel path is plotted on the map


## Technologies, Libraries, and APIs
- MERN stack for creating the app
- Google maps API - Location based functionality, and dynamic map
