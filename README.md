# Landmarked
An online travel journal to track your travels and share with the world.

## Background

##Functionality and MVPs
Landmarked is an interactive site that allows users to browse locations using a map. 
When a user visits a location they are able to create an entry with comments and a photo 
showing off their experience at the location.

Users can also create and complete quests by visiting specified collections of locations.
For example, a user can create an 'extreme mountain climber' quest to visit Mt. Everest and 
Mt Kilamanjaro. Users who complete the quest would get the 'extreme mountain climber' badge to
display on their profile page.

- MERN stack for creating the app
